# 🖼️ Image Classification Project

This repository contains an **image classification** project implemented using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate deep learning models to classify images into different categories.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project includes the following steps:

1. **🧹 Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Data augmentation  
   - Splitting dataset into training, validation, and test sets  

2. **🛠️ Model Development**  
   - Designing multiple deep learning architectures  
   - Using different activation functions and dropout layers  
   - Employing EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting  

3. **📊 Evaluation**  
   - Plotting training and validation accuracy/loss curves  
   - Comparing multiple models with different hyperparameters  

## 📂 Files in the Repository
